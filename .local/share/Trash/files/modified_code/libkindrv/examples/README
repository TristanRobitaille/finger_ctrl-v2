libkindrv_examples
==================

simple examples showing the usage of libkindrv

Compilation:
============

The installation procedure is based on cmake and contains nothing
more than the usual procedure:

  # 1. Make a build directory inside libkindrv's "example" directory

    mkdir build

  # 2. Run cmake from inside the build directory

    cd build
    cmake ..

  # 3. Build the example binaries

    make

Now you have the executable binaries in your working directory
(here it is "build"). Run them to show the results. Also make sure
to check the cpp files to see how libkindrv is actually used.
